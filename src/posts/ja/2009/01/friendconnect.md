I developed [FriendIntroducer][1] as an experiment and was trying to understand how FriendConnect is different from ordinaly OpenSocial implementation. So this time, I&#8217;ve tried to develop a gadget which you can find FriendConnect interesting, Footprints. You know the idea if you&#8217;ve tried MyBlogLog before.

## What is Footprints?

Footprints is a gadget to track visitor of you blog. Look at the gadget on bottom left. If you&#8217;re not joined or signed in, do it to check what it does.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-326" title="Footprints1" src="/images/2009/01/e38394e382afe38381e383a3-5.png" alt="Footprints1" width="223" height="211" />

As you could imagine, this gadget records visitor and its time. When viewed by others, timestamp will be displayed how long ago, you&#8217;ve visited. Also, you can remove your own footprint if you want. The xml is located at:

Feel free to take it and use it on your blog.
