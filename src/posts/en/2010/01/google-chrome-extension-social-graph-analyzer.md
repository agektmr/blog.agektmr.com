I recently started using Google Chrome because extensions are now available on the Dev channel for Mac. It offers the extensibility that Safari lacks, and the lightness and speed that surpasses Firefox, making it a promising browser. It's incredibly easy to use, and is quickly becoming my main browser. That's what you'd expect from Google.

Well, developing an extension for Google Chrome seemed easy, so I decided to give it a try. The extension is called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/homfjkcmjicjclikljgmjfmfmcbkihco" target="_blank">Social Graph Analyzer</a>.

## How to use

Once installed, a person icon will appear in the top right corner of the screen. To use it, simply click on the profile page of the person you're interested in. It doesn't matter which service the profile page is from. When you click, a bubble will pop up, showing you other services that person uses. Of course, the URL of the service is a link, so clicking it will open the page.

Those who know will understand, so I won't go into the details of how it works, but if the information is published using microformat or FOAF and is connected, it may be displayed.

## from now on

In the future, I hope to be able to display the number of services you use with a badge and track your friends just by looking at the page.

It's especially useful for Twitter pages. Please give it a try.
