Recently, Google released a service called <a href="http://buzz.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Buzz</a>.

It's a so-called feed aggregator, and its appearance is similar to GREE or goo Home in Japan, or FriendFeed, Cliqset, or Facebook overseas. It's a very stereotypical service that allows you to comment and favorite entries on your timeline, and doesn't seem to have much individuality at first glance.

The main features of the app were that it was deployed on Gmail, that it would also be displayed on Google Profile, and about five other things that were mentioned on stage. I was watching the live broadcast, and I got the impression that it might be difficult to make this popular.

However, when I looked at the API documentation page that was released at the same time, I realized that Buzz was not just aiming to be a feed aggregator service. I also realized how ambitious and grandiose this was, and that it was the concrete answer to the ideal service I had been dreaming of for over three years. I couldn't contain my excitement.

There's actually a deeper meaning behind the tweet I made: "<a href="http://twitter.com/agektmr/status/8866951003" target="_blank">Whether it's popular or not</a>." I wrote an article explaining this, which was posted on gihyo.jp.

It contains some difficult topics, but if you've tried Google Buzz and thought it was boring and had no chance of becoming popular, I highly recommend you give it a read. I think it will change your perspective.
