[The Chrome extension that became a local hot topic for a while as a girlfriend extension](http://blog.agektmr.com/2013/05/chrome-project-tab-manager-20.html) Project
Tab Manager has reached version 3.0.

<!-- excerpt -->

Project Tab Manager is a Chrome extension that monitors the state of your windows and allows you to restore them to their original state at any time.

* I always have nearly 100 Chrome tabs open.
* Because of this, Chrome alone uses up a lot of memory.
* I find myself checking Twitter and Facebook (and Google+, of course!) while I'm working, which is distracting.

This app is recommended for people like you. 
By slightly shifting the concept from previous versions, we've pursued ease of understanding.
We've placed more emphasis on tracking sessions than on managing projects.

Once you install [Project Tab Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/project-tab-manager/iapdnheekciiecjijobcglkcgeckpoia) (hereafter referred to as PTM), a project will be automatically created for each open window.

If you look at the extension each time you add or remove a tab, you'll see that it keeps track of all your tab state. Try closing a window (instead of just closing all the tabs) and you'll see that the project remains in PTM, and that clicking it will restore the original window.

If you find it annoying that a project is added even though you only temporarily opened a new window, simply close all tabs in the window. The project will be deleted.

The project name can be changed.

Clicking the star on the right will permanently add the page to your project, allowing you to reopen it at any time.

The ☆ is actually a bookmark, and it's registered for each project in "Other Bookmarks." This means you can open it in Chrome on a mobile device or on another computer if your bookmarks are synced.

The PTM popup window has keyboard shortcuts assigned to it, which work as follows:

* **Tab, Shift+Tab** Move Project
* **Return** Open Project Window
* **Right** Expand Project
* **Left** Collapse Project

You can easily open the popup by specifying a shortcut key in the "Keyboard
Shortcuts" section at the bottom of the Chrome Extension management page (chrome://extensions).
