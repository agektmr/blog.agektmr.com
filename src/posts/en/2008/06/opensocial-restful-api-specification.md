The previously published translation of the OpenSocial RESTful API Proposal has been replaced with the [OpenSocial RESTful API
Specification](http://devlog.agektmr.com/wiki/index.php?cmd=read&page=OpenSocial%2FRESTful%20API%20Specification) published with the release of the OpenSocial v0.8 specification.

However, the partial update process is still in TBD (To Be Determined) status. I have inquired about it, so I will update it as soon as it is updated to the latest version.
