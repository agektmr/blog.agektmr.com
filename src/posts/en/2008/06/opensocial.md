OpenSocial containers have also seen the appearance of not only [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/Home.aspx),
[hi5](http://hi5.com/), and [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/), but also
[iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig?hl=en), [hyves](http://www.hyves.nl/), and
[Netlog](http://en.netlog.com/).

Each SNS has its own characteristics, but it is a hassle to check the specifications one by one and check the operation during development. Currently, OpenSocial v0.8 has only just been released, so most are compatible with v0.7, but there is a gadget that allows you to check compatibility with v0.7.

This should make development a little easier.
