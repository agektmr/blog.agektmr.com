I recently wrote about the [offline feature included in Safari 3.1](/archives/16), and amachang has provided a detailed explanation of how to use it.

What is the "Client-side database storage (SQL API)" implemented in Safari 3.1? - IT War Chronicles

I haven't read it in detail, but it seems to be a specification from HTML5, and is already included in the beta version of Firefox 3.

With this, it seems like you can do all sorts of things...
