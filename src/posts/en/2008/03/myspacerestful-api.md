On March 13th, MySpace released the OpenSocial app to the public as a beta version. This is the first OpenSocial-compatible social networking service to be released to the public. However, the OpenSocial specifications have not yet been fully finalized, so why and how?

[OpenSocial Container standard fragmentation &#8211; Implementing OpenSocial Containers | Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-container/browse_thread/thread/96761d3ebd53e32c/646c972cddae2d35)

To summarize the contents:

> MySpace's OpenSocial API appears to have proprietary specifications for both its JavaScript extensions and its RESTful API.
> If things continue as they are, won't we be forced to conform to the specifications created by the world's largest social networking site rather than the standard specifications?

In response to this question, there has been some discussion about whether this is an issue with the Office XML standard specifications or the browser standard specifications, but as of the 21st, a hi5 developer has replied as follows:

We're aware of this issue and would like to resolve it. A discussion will be held next week.
> This discussion was suggested by MySpace, so they should be aware of this issue. We have proposals for a template system, presence, etc.

That's what they say.

It appears that the main body finalizing the OpenSocial specifications is not just Google, but also developers from major US social networking sites other than Facebook, such as hi5, MySpace, and Ning, who come together to submit proposals and make decisions.

> I thought that version 0.7 (at least the JavaScript API) had settled down somewhat.
> But it seems there's still more to come.

It might be a good idea for Japanese developers (including myself) to make suggestions as well.
