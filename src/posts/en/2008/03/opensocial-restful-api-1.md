[Here](http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-and-gadgets-spec/msg/87df6973a9f94fe1?) I have translated the contents of the proposal put out by Google.

[OpenSocial/RESTful API Proposal - Tender Surrender](http://devlog.agektmr.com/wiki/index.php?OpenSocial%2FRESTful%20API%20Proposal)

I did this with speed in mind, so there are probably many mistakes, but if you notice any, please let me know.
