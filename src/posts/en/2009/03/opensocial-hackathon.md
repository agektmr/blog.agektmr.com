The timing coincided with the launch of <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.home.goo.ne.jp/">goo Home Sandbox</a>, and we have decided to jointly host the <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-hackathon-0424">OpenSocial Hackathon</a> with goo, <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-japan">OpenSocial Japan Community</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://mtl.recruit.co.jp/">Recruit Media Technology Lab</a>.

Hackathon is a portmanteau of "hack" and "marathon," and participants are divided into groups and create software by coding on the spot.

This has been held several times in the past, mainly by Google, but this time we will be using <a target="_blank" href="http://sandbox.home.goo.ne.jp/">goo Home Sandbox</a> as a container.
