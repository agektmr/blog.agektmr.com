On March 26th, <a target="_blank" href="http://home.goo.ne.jp/">goo Home</a> began offering a <a target="_blank" href="http://sandbox.home.goo.ne.jp/">sandbox environment</a> for OpenSocial compatibility.

![][1]

Key features include:

* Basic API (People, AppData, Activity)
* Supports home view, canvas view, and profile view
* Privacy support for each user attribute information
* Full coverage of review functions such as requestCreateActivity, requestPermission, requestSendMessage, and requestShareApp
* goo Home Emoji feature
* <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-jquery/">opensocial-jquery</a> feature

Not only is it in Japanese, but in terms of specification coverage, we believe it is a more ideal environment than any other existing container for those coming into contact with OpenSocial for the first time.

We also put a lot of effort into writing the documentation. There isn't much documentation on permissions etc., so we think it will be helpful. Please take a look.
