I originally wrote this on my private blog, but I wanted to share it here as well.

I've been attending study groups and other events a lot lately, and I've always wanted to get a personal business card. However, I don't like the small, everyday cards, and there are so many services that make business cards that I haven't gotten around to getting one... Then I came across this article.

[Blogger business cards, shipping included, only 1000 yen!](http://blog.goo.ne.jp/batacchi/e/f81808a384944befed668cab7a8c3993)

I wanted to be particular about the design, and the price was reasonable, so I thought, "This is it!" and applied right away.

It was only 1,300 yen for 100 full-color sheets, and they were generous enough to let me redo the design as many times as I wanted. I took them up on their offer, and it took about a month to finish, but it's finally finished.

I was talking about blogger business cards, but recently I've been meeting people at study groups and Twitter is the most easily understood, so I made it the main one, with OpenSocial-related content as a bonus. I made the title SocialWeb Japan. Of course, I included the blog URL.

So, I'm happy with the finished product. I've only given it to my wife so far. I hope someone gets it soon!

I'm so grateful to [Maekawa Planning Printing](http://www.kobe-maekawa.co.jp/) for this finish at this price! Please give it a try!
