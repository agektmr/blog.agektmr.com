I'll be giving a talk at the Aizu IT Summer Forum (Aizu IT Summer Forum) to be held at the University of Aizu on September 18th. My session will be about the rather nerdy topic of "OpenSocial Architecture." And since I'm in Aizu, I'll also be holding an OpenSocial Hackathon the following day, the 19th, which will double as a caravan for the Mashup Awards 5 (Mashup Awards 5). Yoichiro Tanaka (mixi), author of an introductory book on OpenSocial, and Ariaki Kawasaki (MTL), author of MTL, will also be participating. This is a rare opportunity for local residents, so please come along. For more details and the participation form, please see here: OpenSocial Hackathon in Aizu (OpenSocial Hackathon in Aizu).
