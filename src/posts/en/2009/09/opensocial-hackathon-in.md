I'll be giving a talk at the [Aizu IT Summer Forum](http://www.ubic-u-aizu.pref.fukushima.jp/it-summer/2009overview) to be held at the University of Aizu on September 18th. In my session, I'll be talking about the rather nerdy topic of "OpenSocial Architecture." And since I'm in Aizu, I'll also be holding an OpenSocial Hackathon the following day, the 19th, which will double as a caravan for the [Mashup Awards 5](http://mashupaward.jp/). [Yoichiro Tanaka](http://www.eisbahn.jp/yoichiro/) from mixi, who wrote an introductory book on OpenSocial, and [Yusuke Kawasaki](http://www.kawa.net/xp/index-j.html) from MTL will also be participating. This is a rare opportunity for local residents, so please come along.
