By chance, I was invited to the "<a href="http://www.atmarkit.co.jp/fwcr/design/meeting02.html" target="_blank">Silly App Championship</a>" even though it wasn't my own work, so I took the opportunity to enter. The event was held at TOKYO CULTURE CULTURE in Odaiba.

The gadget that was announced is the hot topic! It is "<a href="http://platform001.mixi.jp/view_appli.pl?id=1357" target="_blank">Channel</a>" by <a href="http://yamashita.dyndns.org/blog/obaka-application-championship/" target="_blank">weboo</a>.

Channee is a social app that uses OpenSocial. The idea is to find a hairstyle that suits you by choosing your favorite from two photos of Channee that are displayed one after another. You can also reserve a specific hairstyle. You can see your friends' favorite hairstyles, and your favorites are reflected in the activity stream, which gives it a social app feel.

Well, I didn't do anything at all in the development.

Due to some common issues that arise during a live demo, we ended up using the mixi app instead of the goo home sandbox we had planned to use for the demo, which meant we didn't get a chance to show off the various features that weboo had prepared, which was a bit disappointing.

However, <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/technohippy/20090704#1247062733" target="_blank">Boob Engineer</a>, who also competed on Team Sexy, made up for it with some excellent conversation with <a href="http://punitouch.appspot.com/" target="_blank">puniTouch</a>, so it all worked out in the end.

It was a very unique and fun event. I hope to enter next time with my own work.

Please see the report here. There is also a video.
