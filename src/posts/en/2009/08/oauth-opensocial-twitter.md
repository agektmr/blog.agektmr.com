To coincide with the release of the OAuth feature of <a href="http://home.goo.ne.jp/" target="_blank">goo Home</a>, we have released a gadget called "<a href="http://home.goo.ne.jp/gadget/qYpTF5ucNCt2/detail" target="_blank">GadgeTweetr" (English name: </a>), which uses OAuth from <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. While it's just a gadget, we think it's simpler, more powerful, and easier to use than your average Twitter client, so we'd like to introduce it to you.

*The font used for the Gadget Tweet! logo is "<a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/y05k/20070519/p1" target="_blank">Tsukitteru</a>".

## Main features

* OAuth login function
* Tab function
* Reply source display function
* Search function
* Multi-account support

## OAuth login function

It supports <a href="http://oauth.net/core/1.0" target="_blank">OAuth</a>, so you don't have to enter your ID and password directly into the goo home page. By clicking the "Login" button, a screen on the twitter.com domain will open, allowing users to log in with peace of mind.

## Tab function

This Twitter client displays various types of statuses side by side in tabs. It supports a full range of displays, including Timeline, Mentions, Direct Messages, and Favorites.

## Supports multiple accounts

You can add as many gadgets as you like and each can have a different account.

## Other features

### Three views

It corresponds to the home, profile, and canvas views. Home opens Timeline and Mentions by default, profile opens the user's status by default, and canvas opens Timeline, Mentions, Direct Message, and Favorites by default.

### Automatic linking function

It detects and turns into links not only external URLs, but also IDs specified with @ and hashtags specified with #. URLs open a new window, but @ and # create a new tab and display a status list.

### ReTweet function

You can "ReTweet" tweets you like by clicking this icon. Of course, you can add comments.

### Profile display function

Click on the icon to view profile information such as the number of followers and posts.

### Follow and unfollow function

You can follow someone directly from their profile, or unfollow them if you're already following them.

## summary

Since this is a Twitter client built on OpenSocial, we had prepared some unique social features, but unfortunately we were unable to make it in time for this announcement (we will release them as soon as they are implemented).

However, even though we started out making it just to let people experience goo Home's OAuth, it ended up being simple yet highly functional. Please give Gadget Tweet a try.
