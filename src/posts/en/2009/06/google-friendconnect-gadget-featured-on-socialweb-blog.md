A long time ago, I created a Footprint Gadget called <a href="http://devlog.agektmr.com/archives/325" target="_blank"> Footprint Gadget</a> for Google FriendConnect.

I have been letting acquaintances and people who happen to come across this blog use it little by little, but when the FriendConnect gadget directory was recently created, I thought it would be a good opportunity to have it featured here <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/home/gadgets?hl=en-US&gl=US&category=all" target="_blank">here</a>.

Then, after that, I received a request from Google saying, "It's such a great gadget, we'll add it to our 'Featured' list, so we'd love for you to write a blog post about it" (slightly embellished), and so I wrote this blog.

<a href="http://googlesocialweb.blogspot.com/2009/06/see-whos-visiting-to-your-site-with.html" target="_blank">Social Web Blog: See who's visiting your site with Footprints gadget</a>

That's why I posted it.

Actually, this gadget supports Japanese and used to work, but since the Social bar became available in GFC, it has been English-only, so when I asked about this, I was told that it will be internationalized soon. So, the "Footprints gadget" may become available as the "Footprints gadget."

Setting up Google FriendConnect is fairly easy. If you've read this article, we encourage you to try installing the Footprint Gadget and <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/" target="_blank">Google FriendConnect</a> on your own blog.
