On January 23rd, we held the Social Web Study Group Vol. 1 at the DeNA office. 50 people attended, and it was such a success that there was a waiting list. The study group really showed how much attention the Social Web is receiving.

In my presentation, as the organizer, I outlined the future direction of the community, as well as the direction being taken by current overseas services and how the main players are actually working towards the social web. Much of the content has already been covered on this blog, but I think it was a good summary.

I have uploaded the slides to SlideShare, so I will post them here. <strike>The font has changed, so some parts may be a little difficult to read, </strike>but you can download them, so please take a look.

In addition, [Yoichiro][2] gave a presentation on introducing OpenSocial, and [id:ZIGOROu][3] gave a presentation introducing OpenID trends in 2009. More details will be posted on this page <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/socialweb-japan/web/socialweb-vol-1-2"> in the future. Please check it out.

Finally, I would like to thank DeNA for providing the venue and all the DeNA employees who helped out. Thank you very much.

**Additional Note:** I forgot to write about the Paypal + OpenPNE presentation that Kamibe-san joined in on the spot. It was a very interesting talk that also touched on the monetization through in-app purchases that I mentioned in my presentation.

Additional note: After converting the PowerPoint to PDF and re-uploading it to SlideShare, it now displays nicely.
