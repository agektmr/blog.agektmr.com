Been wanting to make this blog multilingual for a while, I just found a good plugin to do it.

<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-multilingual/#post-5056" target="_blank">WP_Multilingual</a> is a multilangual plugin for WordPress. It's not an auto-translator, you have to post in each languages but, those languages will be tied to the single entry and viewer's preferred language is automatically detected using request header. This was an ideal functionality I've been looking for.

Just one problem, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">Dean&#8217;t FCKEditor</a> doesn&#8217;t seem to work quite well on japanese which you must install along with WP_Multilingual. ghh

Anyway, it looks ok just to internationalize. I'll look for solution about editor.
