*This article has been updated from an article originally published on May 2, 2012.

Have you heard of the site [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/)? HTML5Rocks is one of the world's leading sources of HTML5-related information, featuring tutorials, samples, slides, videos, and more. The site was primarily developed by Google's Chrome Developer Relations team, and while it was originally only available in English, in May 2012 it underwent i18n (internationalization) and became available in nine languages, and has also begun adding [Japanese content](http://www.html5rocks.com/ja/).

Although the amount is still not large, we believe that developers who have been reluctant to read English in the past can now use it as a comprehensive source of information. Let us introduce some of the articles that have already been translated.

### [Reading a file using the File API in JavaScript](http://www.html5rocks.com/ja/tutorials/file/dndfiles/)

A getting started guide to working with and reading binary files in JavaScript using the File / FileList / FileReader APIs.

### [Native HTML5 Drag and Drop](http://www.html5rocks.com/ja/tutorials/dnd/basics/)

Drag and drop is also a key feature of HTML5, and in this article we'll show you how to enhance your web applications by adding native drag and drop functionality.

### [Learn about the File System API](http://www.html5rocks.com/ja/tutorials/file/filesystem/)

The File System API allows applications to read and write files and directories to a protected, sandboxed file system on a user's local computer.

##Contributions now being accepted!

Did you know that the HTML5Rocks website itself is actually developed as open source? The repository is below.

[https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com](https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com)

And actually (and this is the main point), HTML5Rocks is looking for Japanese translations of articles. As is generally the case with documents that are translated into multiple languages, the reality is that it is extremely difficult to keep translations up to date. That's why HTML5Rocks is taking advantage of the fact that it is open source and is accepting translations from everyone. We have already received contributions from people such as [@kuu](http://github.com/kuu), [@ukyo](http://github.com/ukyo), [@Layzie](http://github.com/Layzie), [@pikotea](http://github.com/pikotea), and [@iizukak](https://github.com/iizukak), but we still have a long way to go on newer articles.

If you are even slightly interested, please first read the [Style Guide](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/style-guide) and, if you have actually translated something, please send us a pull request. Also, the design has recently changed, and it is now possible to include credits for translators. Please refer to the Translations section of the Style Guide and enter your name.

We previously received an inquiry from someone who said, "I'm unsure whether to translate something because there's a possibility that it will overlap with other people's translations." However, since we've now moved to GitHub, if you create an issue when you start translating, we will take that order into consideration when accepting pull requests.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us on [Google+](http://google.com/+agektmr) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/agektmr). We look forward to your contributions!
