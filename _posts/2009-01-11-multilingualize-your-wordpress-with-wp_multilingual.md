Been wanting to make this blog multilingual for a while, I just found a good plugin to do it.

<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-multilingual/#post-5056" target="_blank">WP_Multilingual</a> is a multilangual plugin for WordPress. It&#8217;s not an auto-translator, you have to post in each languages but, those languages will be tied to the single entry and viewer&#8217;s preferred language is automatically detected using request header. This was an ideal functionality I&#8217;ve been looking for.

Just one problem, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">Dean&#8217;t FCKEditor</a> doesn&#8217;t seem to work quite well on japanese which you must install along with WP_Multilingual. ghh

Anyway, it looks ok just to internationalize. I&#8217;ll look for solution about editor.
