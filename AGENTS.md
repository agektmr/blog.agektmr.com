## Image generation

- The featured images must be 16:9 aspect ratio.
- The featured images must be at least 1080p.
- Place the features images under `/src/images/<year>` and name it based on the article name.
- The featured images reference in markdown should start from `/<year>` instead of the full path, because the template starts with `/src/images`.
