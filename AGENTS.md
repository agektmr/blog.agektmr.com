## Writing convention

- In Japanese article, append a space before and after a English word except when the word before or after is a symbol.

## Image generation guidelines

- The featured images must be 16:9 aspect ratio.
- The featured images must be at least 1080p.
- Place the features images under `/src/images/<year>` and name it based on the article name.
- The featured images reference in markdown should start from `/<year>` instead of the full path, because the template starts with `/src/images`.

## Translation guidelines

- When I request to translate an article, please translate it to English if it's in Japanese and vice versa.
- Place the translated article under `/src/posts/<language>/<year>` and name it the same as the original article.
- Before translating an article, look at the destination and see if it's already translated. If it is, please update the translation instead of creating a new article.
- Don't translate link titles.
